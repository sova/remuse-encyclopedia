**Statiochromia** - When a band uses all their instruments for the entire duration of a song. Bass, guitar, drums, vocals all present from start to finish with no dynamic orchestration. Very un-Beatles.

**Fantawave** -  Future Fantasy Wave.  Projection ideas for what music sounds like in a distant future. Complex rhythmic patterns with abstract, futuristic textures.
