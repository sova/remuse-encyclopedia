# Band of Horses

Reverb-soaked indie rock with Americana leanings. Ben Bridwell's high, wobbly vocals over lush arrangements. Not quite statiochromia—they build and pull back dynamically.

## Members
- Ben Bridwell (vocals, guitar) - sole constant member
- Creighton Barrett (drums, 2006-present)
- Ryan Monroe (keyboards, guitar, 2007-present)
- Matt Gentling (bass, 2017-present)
- Brett Nash (guitar, 2017-present)

Former members include Mat Brooke (2004-06), Tyler Ramsey (2007-17), Bill Reynolds (2007-17).

## Notes
Formed from the ashes of Carissa's Wierd. "The Funeral" became ubiquitous in mid-2000s TV/film. Sound evokes wide-open spaces and melancholy.

## Discography

  <span class="album">Everything All the Time</span> — <span class="song">The Funeral</span>
</div>

Classic track, intro guitar sliding notes sound like mini purring kittens.  Captures an era, a moment in time, it reflects the zeitgeist of the period in which it was released (March 2006), vocals softly layer until we bust into a rock beat slowly lurching.  "At every occasion, I'll be ready for the funeral."  The shattering of cymbals and hi-hats makes a spatial sonic tsunami that effortlessly builds on itself, like a staccato roll of thunder, with melodic guitar tones guiding.
