# The Black Angels

Austin psych-rock band formed May 2004.

## Members

- Stephanie Bailey (drums)
- Jake Garcia (guitar)
- Ramiro Verdooren (multi-instrumentalist)

## Overview
Took their name from the Velvet Underground's "The Black Angel's Death Song". Heavy-duty psychedelic rock with an incessant primitive beat that echoes the spirit of the 13th Floor Elevators, Syd Barrett, Roky Erickson, and Arthur Lee. Dense layers, droning guitars, Maas's baritone vocals over martial drumming from Bailey.

- *Passover* (2006) - debut, includes "Young Men Dead"
- *Directions to See a Ghost* (2008)

## Cultural Impact
More than a band, the Black Angels launched a revival, consciously building on psychedelic rock's Austin origins. Co-founded Austin Psych Fest (2008), which became Levitation festival - now a major psych/garage rock platform internationally.
